# API Conventions

## API Route Structure

Every API route must follow this order. Do not skip steps.

```
0. Handle CORS preflight (OPTIONS) if the route accepts cross-origin requests
1. Apply rate limit (lib/rate-limit.ts)
2. Auth — currentUser() / requireAdmin() / signature / bearer token (see SECURITY.md for exceptions)
3. Input validation (Zod schema)
4. Ownership / authorization check
5. Business logic
6. AI event tracking (only if an OpenAI call was made)
7. Return response with appropriate status code
```

Steps 0 and 2 may vary for webhooks, cron, and internal routes — see `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## Error Handling

- Return generic error messages to clients. Never expose stack traces or internal details.
- Use `console.error()` for server-side logging — it is the only allowed console method per ESLint config.
- Detailed error info only in `NODE_ENV === "development"`.
- Always return appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - 400 — bad input
  - 401 — unauthenticated
  - 403 — forbidden (authenticated but not authorized)
  - 404 — not found
  - 429 — rate limited

---

## Database

- Use Prisma client (`lib/prisma.ts`) for all queries — never raw SQL in API routes.
- SQL migrations go in `/database` directory, numbered sequentially.
- Always add appropriate indexes for new query patterns.
- Use cascade deletes for child records (configured in Prisma schema).
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate data (e.g., `[session_id, q_idx]`).

---

## AI Integration

- All OpenAI calls MUST be tracked in the `ai_events` table (tokens, latency, cost).
- Use models defined in env vars (`AI_MODEL`, `AI_MODEL_HEAVY`) — never hardcode model names.
- Implement retry logic for 429/5xx responses (max 3 attempts).
- Rate limit AI endpoints to prevent runaway costs.

---

## State Management (Client)

- Server state: React Query with appropriate `staleTime` (see `components/providers/QueryProvider.tsx`).
- Query keys defined in `lib/query-keys.ts` — always use these, never ad-hoc strings.
- No Redux or Zustand — use React Query for server cache, React state/context for UI state.
- Custom hooks in `/hooks` directory for reusable state patterns.
